<h1>Lebron's Lesson</h1>
<p>Hey guys,

How are all of MY Wheels for Ed kids doing? Man, I miss you guys! I’ve been down in Miami, Florida, working out and getting ready for the season. You know how you went to tech and training camp this summer? Well, I have to go to my own training camp TOMORROW! I can’t wait, I’m excited for the season to start.

I was reading over our PROMISE this morning and the first line caught my eye, “I PROMISE to go to school.” All of my kids have been going to school, right? I know that sometimes it’s hard to get out of bed. These past few weeks, all I wanted to do was sleep in and eat waffles. Instead, they dragged me out of bed at the crack of dawn! I couldn’t stay in my bed if I tried, I thought to myself, “If I ask my kids to get up early for school, I better get up early to work out.” 

If you ever have a doubt about going to school because you feel tired, I want you to look down at your I PROMISE band and remember that you and I are in this together.

Your friend,

Mr. LeBron </p
