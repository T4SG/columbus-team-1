<h5 style="margin: 40px; padding:20px length: 30px";>Hey guys,<br><br>

How are all of MY Wheels for Ed kids doing? Man, I miss you guys! I&#8217ve been down in Miami, Florida, working out and getting ready for the season. You know how you went to tech and training camp this summer? Well, I have to go to my own training camp TOMORROW! I can&#8217t wait, I&#8217m excited for the season to start.

I was reading over our PROMISE this morning and the first line caught my eye, <q>I PROMISE to go to school.</q> All of my kids have been going to school, right? I know that sometimes it&#8217s hard to get out of bed. These past few weeks, all I wanted to do was sleep in and eat waffles. Instead, they dragged me out of bed at the crack of dawn! I couldn&#8217t stay in my bed if I tried, I thought to myself, <q>If I ask my kids to get up early for school, I better get up early to work out.</q> 

If you ever have a doubt about going to school because you feel tired, I want you to look down at your I PROMISE band and remember that you and I are in this together.
<br><br>
Your friend,
<br>
Mr. LeBron </h5>
